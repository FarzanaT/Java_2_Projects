# Directions
1. You will provide a short explanation about a set of `bash` shell commands
  * You will use `###` followed by a command name ```<command>``` (this will add a nice header)
  * You will save **Readme.md**  and then **add** it to your staging area  
  * You will type *git status* to see if you have done it correctly
1. On Windows you can use *gitbash*, on macOS *terminal* (even if you use **zsh**)
1. Every single command will be followed by a *commit* message, in the following format:
  * Add ```<command>``` explanation
1. You will push your changes back to *GitHub*
2. You will type ```git log --oneline``` to see the sequence of your commits
3. You will submit the link to your *GitHub* repository back to Canvas 

## The list of commands to cover
Note: replace ```<command>``` with the following names
* cd ### <change directory to reach a specific directory>
* ls ### <list of contents in the current directory>
* cp ### <making a copy of the file>
* mv
* dir
* mkdir
* pwd
* rm
* find
* nano

### Note:
When I use the command line, I use `pwd` followed by `ls` between the commands I type. If you develop this habbit, you will be less prone to make errors while deleting or renaming files.
